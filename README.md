## Tweaks & Workbench theming

If you want to play around with new colors, use the setting
`workbench.colorCustomizations` to customize the currently selected theme. For
example, you can add this snippet in your "settings.json" file:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations":{
  "tab.activeBackground": "#282c34",
  "activityBar.background": "#282c34",
  "editorGroup.background": "#282c34",
  "sideBar.background": "#282c34"
}
```
